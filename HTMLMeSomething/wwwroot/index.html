                <h3>The starry-eyed dreams</h3>
                I was fresh out of college with an Audio Production degree. I had fallen in love with a guy at college. He had a degree in the same thing I did.
                When I finished classes we moved out to California. I was young, dumb, and as infatuated as any 22 year old girl could possibly be.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h3>The brutal reality</h3>
                The relationship was not as expected, it was tumultuous at best. I'll spare you the details. Work was hard to come by. I spiraled into severe depression and poor eating habits.
                I had high blood pressure. My health suffered. Eventually, the clouds cleared and the boyfriend and I broke up.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h3>The recovery and the reboot</h3>
                I moved back to St. Louis and found stable employment. I joined a gym and started taking fitness classes.
                I started eating better, my mental and physical health improved. I accidentally stumbled upon POUND fitness and ordered a DVD and a pair of Ripstix. It was love at first strike!
                I wanted to help others and I had to teach POUND. It is a cardio jam session that will make you feel like a rockstar! POUND uses Pilates-based movements combined with Ripstix
                and drumming set to a rockin' setlist. It is a great way to get healthy, release stress, and have a little fun while doing it. Fitness is a passion, but POUND is my true love.
                <br />
                My story is not over. Always a work in progress!
